                    <ol>

                    <li><strong>Severability</strong>: If a court of competent jurisdiction finds that this Class Action Waiver is unenforceable for any reason with respect to a particular Dispute, then that Dispute must proceed in a court of competent jurisdiction (as set forth in Section 14.7) and <strong>not</strong> in arbitration.</li>

                    <p>Prior to initiating any formal Dispute resolution procedure (arbitration or court action), both parties agree to make a <strong>good-faith effort</strong> to <strong>resolve</strong> any Dispute <strong>informally</strong> by contacting each other (via email or written notice) and discussing the matter for at least <strong>thirty (30) days</strong>.</p>
                    <h4>14.7 Venue and Jurisdiction (Non-Arbitrable Claims)</h4>
                    <p>For any claim or Dispute that is not subject to arbitration (including a Dispute deemed not arbitrable by the arbitrator or if the arbitration provision is found unenforceable in whole or in part), such legal suit, action, or proceeding shall be exclusively brought in the <strong>state or federal courts</strong> located in <strong>Duval County, Florida</strong>, and the parties consent to personal jurisdiction and venue in those courts.</p>
                    <h4>14.8 Waiver of Jury Trial</h4>
